Configuration Options
***********************************************************************************************************************/
/* Checking of arguments passed to RSPI API functions can be enable or disabled.
 * Disabling argument checking is provided for systems that absolutely require faster and smaller code.
 * By default the module is configured to use the setting of the system-wide BSP_CFG_PARAM_CHECKING_ENABLE macro.
 * This can be overridden for the local module by redefining RSPI_CFG_PARAM_CHECKING_ENABLE.
 * To control parameter checking locally, set RSPI_CFG_PARAM_CHECKING_ENABLE to 1 to enable it,
 * otherwise set to 0 skip checking.

/* When  reading the RSPI received data register for data frame bit lengths

 * values from the transmit data. As a convenience, these unused upper bits
 * may be optionally masked off (cleared to 0) by the driver when the data
 * is transferred to the user-data buffer.
 * Since this takes additional processing time in the data transfer interrupt handler
 * it will cause a reduction in performance for the highest bit rate settings.
 * This is not needed for 8, 16, or 32-bit transfers. So only enable this option
 * when using data frame bit lengths that are not 8, 16, or 32-bits. */
