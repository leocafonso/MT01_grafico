 *
 *	All cm_probe_cycle_start does is prevent any new commands from queueing to the
 *	planner so that the planner can move to a sop and report MACHINE_PROGRAM_STOP.
 *	OK, it also queues the function that's called once motion has stopped.
 *
 *	Note: When coding a cycle (like this one) you get to perform one queued move per
 *	entry into the continuation, then you must exit.
 *
 *	Another Note: When coding a cycle (like this one) you must wait until
 *	the last move has actually been queued (or has finished) before declaring
 *	the cycle to be done. Otherwise there is a nasty race condition in the
 *	tg_controller() that will accept the next command before the position of
 *	the final move has been recorded in the Gcode model. That's what the call
 *	to cm_get_runtime_busy() is about.
